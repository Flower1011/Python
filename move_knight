'''Write a function move_knight which takes in a list coords_and_dirs, whose first element is a list, indicating the coordinates of the Knight's starting position, 
and whose second element is a four-character string, indicating where the Knight should move in one turn.

A Knight must move exactly three spaces, either two spaces in a vertical direction and one in a horizontal direction, 
or one space in a vertical direction and two spaces in a horizontal direction.

Assume the string at the first index of coords_and_dirs will always be formatted such that:

  The first character is either 'U' or 'D' (where 'U' is up and 'D' is down) and represents the file (vertical direction)

  The second character is either '1' or '2' and represents how many spaces in the vertical direction the Knight will travel
  
  The third character is either 'L' or 'R' (where 'L' is left and 'R' is right) and represents the rank (horizontal direction)
  
  The fourth character is either '1' or '2' and represents how many spaces in the horizontal direction the Knight will travel

For example: "U1L2" would read as "up one space, left two spaces".



The chess board is a grid, with each space identified as [file, rank]:

  [0, 7] --> .    .    .    .    .    .    .    . <-- [7, 7]

             .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

             .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

             .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

             .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

             .    .    .    .    .    .    .    .

             .    .    .    .    .    .    .    . 

  [0, 0] --> .    .    .    .    .    .    .    . <-- [7, 0]

For example: The starting coordinates [7, 7] would represent the knight starting in the upper right corner of the chess board.



If the given directions would be an illegal move, or if the move would cause the Knight to fall off the board, return the string "Illegal Move - Horsey Down!"

Else, the function should return a string with updated file and rank, formatted as such: "The knight has moved to [file, rank]."
