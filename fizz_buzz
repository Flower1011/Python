# Write control flow that prints every number from 1 up to num inclusively. 
However, if the current number is evenly divisible by 3, print "Full" instead, 
if the current number is evenly divisible by 5, 
print "Stack" instead, and if the current number is evenly divisible by BOTH 3 and 5, 
print out "FullStack" instead. 
Note that the variable num has already been 
defined for you in the fizz_buzz_fullstack function definition.
